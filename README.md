# camunda-worker-java

Attempts at setting up a Java-based worker for Camunda.

You'll need to add the file `application.properties` with all relevant info to
the `src/main/resources` folder (see the spring-zeebe Github page for details).

I make no guarantees that any of this stuff is correct, try at your own peril ;)
